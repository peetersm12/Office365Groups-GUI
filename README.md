# Office365Groups-GUI
PowerShell UI Tool for retrieving Office365 groups and restore deleted groups

Requirements:
- At least Exchange and User administrator permissions in Office365. Being Global Administrator will certainly do the job.
- You will need to install the preview version of the Azure AD Module to be able to restore Office365 Groups. 
	The Azure AD preview module can be imported using install-module AzureADPreview.
